# Health Care Analytics Project Report

## Introduction
The "Health Care Analytics" project was designed to provide comprehensive insights into patient health data, helping to identify trends, risk factors, and correlations that can support informed decision-making in healthcare environments. Leveraging a dataset containing diagnostic data, patient demographics, and health-related habits, the project focuses on key metrics like the prevalence of heart diseases, stroke, smoking habits, exercise patterns, and more. The project was executed using Power BI, where an interactive dashboard was created to visualize and analyze the data for better decision-making.

## Description
The dataset for the project included details such as patient diagnoses, weight, exercise habits, smoking patterns, occupation, and various health risks. The following key requirements were used as the foundation for the analysis:

- Total number of patient diagnoses in the dataset
- Percentage of patients with a history of heart attacks and strokes
- Female patients who are not overweight
- Health risk categorization across the dataset
- Impact of lifestyle choices such as smoking and exercise on health risks
- Detailed breakdown of health data across demographic groups like occupation, race, and age.

## Findings

### 1. Total Number of Patient Diagnoses
- **Total Diagnoses:** The dataset includes **5,191 patients** diagnosed with various conditions. This number provides a comprehensive view of the healthcare demands reflected in the dataset.

### 2. Percentage of Patients with a History of Heart Attack
- **Heart Attack History:** Approximately **37%** of the patients in the dataset have a history of heart attacks, emphasizing the need for cardiac-focused healthcare interventions.

### 3. Percentage of Patients with a History of Stroke
- **Stroke History:** **14%** of the patients have a history of strokes, making this another critical area for medical attention and preventive measures.

### 4. Count of Female Patients Who Are Not Overweight
- **Female Patients (Not Overweight):** The analysis found **1,409 female patients** in the dataset who do not fall under the overweight category. This metric is essential for understanding gender-based health trends.

### 5. Number of Patients Based on Health Risk
- The dataset categorized patients by four main health risk categories:
  - **Normal Risk**
  - **Low Risk**
  - **Moderate Risk**
  - **High Risk**
  
  These categories help identify patients requiring immediate attention and those who are at a lower risk.

### 6. Average Weight of People Based on Occupation
- The **average weight** of patients was calculated based on their occupation. This data can help correlate certain professions with higher or lower body weight averages, potentially guiding targeted health interventions for specific workforce sectors.

### 7. Total Number of Overweight Patients Based on Race
- The data provides a **breakdown of overweight patients** across different racial groups. This helps identify racial disparities in weight-related health risks and can be critical for designing culturally sensitive health programs.

### 8. Number of Normal Health Candidates in Each Age Group
- The distribution of **normal health candidates by age group** was identified. The analysis could help understand which age groups maintain better health and which require more preventive healthcare measures.

### 9. Number of Patients Who Smoke and Are at High Health Risk
- **Patients who smoke** and are classified as having a high health risk represent a specific group that could benefit from targeted cessation programs, given their heightened health risks. This metric helps link lifestyle choices like smoking to serious health outcomes.

### 10. Number of Patients Who Exercise Less Than 30 Minutes and Are at High or Moderate Health Risk
- The dataset also identifies the **number of patients who exercise less than 30 minutes daily** and are classified under **high or moderate health risk** categories. These patients can be targeted for lifestyle interventions aimed at reducing health risks through increased physical activity.

## Visualization and Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard created for this project provides interactive visualizations that help healthcare professionals easily explore and interpret the data. Key visual components include:

- **Pie charts** for the distribution of heart attack and stroke history among patients.
- **Bar graphs** representing the breakdown of patients based on health risks and demographics such as gender, race, and occupation.
- **Line charts** to observe trends in exercise habits and smoking behavior in relation to health risks.

The dashboard enables dynamic filtering of the data, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific areas of interest, such as age groups, health risks, or lifestyle factors. The visualizations offer clear, actionable insights that can inform healthcare strategies aimed at improving patient outcomes.

## Conclusion
The Health Care Analytics project provides valuable insights into patient health data, identifying significant health trends, risk factors, and correlations. Key findings, such as the high percentage of patients with heart attack and stroke history, underline the critical areas where healthcare providers need to focus their attention. Additionally, the project demonstrates the importance of lifestyle factors, like smoking and exercise, in determining health outcomes.

The interactive Power BI dashboard is a powerful tool for healthcare professionals to explore the data and make informed decisions. Further, the project can serve as a baseline for developing interventions aimed at mitigating health risks and promoting healthier lifestyles among patient populations.
